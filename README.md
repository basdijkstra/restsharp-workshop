RestSharp workshop
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [RestSharp](https://restsharp.dev/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

What do I need?
---
.NET 8, 9 or 10 and an IDE of your choice. That's it.

What topics do you cover in this workshop?
---
* Writing basic tests for REST APIs using RestSharp
* Creating and running data driven tests using RestSharp and NUnit
* (De-)serializing C# objects to/from JSON
* Writing tests for GraphQL APIs

What APIs are invoked in the tests?
---
All API calls that you should make in the exercises are mocked using [WireMock.Net](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net). All mock definitions are included in the project, so you can focus on learning RestSharp.

Running the tests from the command line
---

```bash
dotnet test
```

Slides
---
The .pptx/.pdf/.odp file in the root folder contains all slides from the workshop. Again, feel free to use, share and adapt them to fit your own requirements.

Comments? Saying thanks?
---
Feel free to file an issue here or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'd rather have you deliver the workshop instead...
---
Sure, I'd love to. Again, send me an email and I'll be happy to discuss options. In house or at your conference, I'm sure we can work something out.
